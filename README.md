# Stat Demo Generator

## Introduction

This is an app where statistics teachers can generate data and distributions for use in classroom activities. Teachers will be able to choose whether to generate binary categorical data or quantitative data from a gaussian distribution. They will be given back a randomly generated data set (randomness will be provided via the Random.org API) and a summary distribution (binom or normal curve as appropriate).
